# UndergradThesis
Thesis created for Portland State Honors program

This thesis was wrtiten over the course of two terms.

My research question is: Effective? Ethical? Behavior Control & Algorithmic Management in Virtual Environments 

In this paper I look at what makes behavior control tools used in the owrkplace effective and ethical.
I do this by creating two seperate frameworks fro ethical and effective use on control tools used by work providers.

I then use the created frameworks to assess the tools used by two seperate companies that I did case studies for.
Upwork and Uber are the chosen companies.

The control tools I look at are focused on software created to monitor workers in virtual environments.

I chose virtual environments/ platform work as some sort of system is needed to make sure workers are doing there work.
